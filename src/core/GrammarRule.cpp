#include "GrammarRule.h"

/*
 GrammarRule is an abstract base class.
 
 This file exists mainly for:
  - Future shared logic
  - Logging hooks
  - Rule metadata (priority, confidence, etc.)

 Right now it is intentionally minimal.
 
 IMPORTANT:
 Even if empty today, keeping this .cpp file is GOOD DESIGN.
 Large NLP engines evolve here.
